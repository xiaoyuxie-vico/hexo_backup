# Assignment 1: Build a Conditional GAN

### Goals
In this notebook, you're going to make a conditional GAN in order to generate hand-written images of digits, conditioned on the digit to be generated (the class vector). This will let you choose what digit you want to generate.

You'll then do some exploration of the generated images to visualize what the noise and class vectors mean.  

<!-- more -->

### Learning Objectives
1.   Learn the technical difference between a conditional and unconditional GAN.
2.   Understand the distinction between the class and noise vector in a conditional GAN.



## Getting Started

For this assignment, you will be using the MNIST dataset again, but there's nothing stopping you from applying this generator code to produce images of animals conditioned on the species or pictures of faces conditioned on facial characteristics.

Note that this assignment requires no changes to the architectures of the generator or discriminator, only changes to the data passed to both. The generator will no longer take `z_dim` as an argument, but  `input_dim` instead, since you need to pass in both the noise and class vectors. In addition to good variable naming, this also means that you can use the generator and discriminator code you have previously written with different parameters.

You will begin by importing the necessary libraries and building the generator and discriminator.

        '''
        disc_pred = self.disc(image)
        return disc_pred.view(len(disc_pred), -1)
```

## Class Input

In conditional GANs, the input vector for the generator will also need to include the class information. The class is represented using a one-hot encoded vector where its length is the number of classes and each index represents a class. The vector is all 0's and a 1 on the chosen class. Given the labels of multiple images (e.g. from a batch) and number of classes, please create one-hot vectors for each label. There is a class within the PyTorch functional library that can help you.

```python
# UNQ_C1 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: get_one_hot_labels

import torch.nn.functional as F
def get_one_hot_labels(labels, n_classes):
    '''
    Function for creating one-hot vectors for the labels, returns a tensor of shape (?, num_classes).
    Parameters:
        labels: tensor of labels from the dataloader, size (?)
        n_classes: the total number of classes in the dataset, an integer scalar
    '''
    #### START CODE HERE ####
    return F.one_hot(labels, n_classes).float()
    #### END CODE HERE ####
```


```python
assert (
    get_one_hot_labels(
        labels=torch.Tensor([[0, 2, 1]]).long(),
        n_classes=3
    ).tolist() == 
    [[
      [1, 0, 0], 
      [0, 0, 1], 
      [0, 1, 0]
    ]]
)
print("Success!")
```

    Success!


Next, you need to be able to concatenate the one-hot class vector to the noise vector before giving it to the generator. You will also need to do this when adding the class channels to the discriminator.

To do this, you will need to write a function that combines two vectors. Remember that you need to ensure that the vectors are the same type: floats. Again, you can look to the PyTorch library for help.

2.   The documentation for [torch.cat](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.cat.html) may be helpful.
3.   Specifically, you might want to look at what the `dim` argument of `torch.cat` does.

```python
# UNQ_C2 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: combine_vectors
def combine_vectors(x, y):
    '''
    Function for combining two vectors with shapes (n_samples, ?) and (n_samples, ?).
    Parameters:
      x: (n_samples, ?) the first vector. 
        In this assignment, this will be the noise vector of shape (n_samples, z_dim), 
        but you shouldn't need to know the second dimension's size.
      y: (n_samples, ?) the second vector.
        Once again, in this assignment this will be the one-hot class vector 
        with the shape (n_samples, n_classes), but you shouldn't assume this in your code.
    '''
    # Note: Make sure this function outputs a float no matter what inputs it receives
    #### START CODE HERE ####
    combined = torch.cat((x, y), 1).float()
    #### END CODE HERE ####
    return combined
```


```python
combined = combine_vectors(torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]]));
# Check exact order of elements
assert torch.all(combined == torch.tensor([[1, 2, 5, 6], [3, 4, 7, 8]]))
# Tests that items are of float type
assert (type(combined[0][0].item()) == float)
# Check shapes
combined = combine_vectors(torch.randn(1, 4, 5), torch.randn(1, 8, 5));
assert tuple(combined.shape) == (1, 12, 5)
assert tuple(combine_vectors(torch.randn(1, 10, 12).long(), torch.randn(1, 20, 12).long()).shape) == (1, 30, 12)
print("Success!")
```

    Success!


## Training
Now you can start to put it all together!
First, you will define some new parameters:

*   mnist_shape: the number of pixels in each MNIST image, which has dimensions 28 x 28 and one channel (because it's black-and-white) so 1 x 28 x 28
*   n_classes: the number of classes in MNIST (10, since there are the digits from 0 to 9)


```python
mnist_shape = (1, 28, 28)
n_classes = 10
```

And you also include the same parameters from previous assignments:

  *   criterion: the loss function
  *   n_epochs: the number of times you iterate through the entire dataset when training
  *   z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector
  *   display_step: how often to display/visualize the images
  *   batch_size: the number of images per forward/backward pass
  *   lr: the learning rate
  *   device: the device type



```python
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
n_epochs = 200
z_dim = 64
display_step = 500
batch_size = 128
lr = 0.0002
device = 'cuda'

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,)),
])

dataloader = DataLoader(
    MNIST('.', download=False, transform=transform),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    shuffle=True)
```

Then, you can initialize your generator, discriminator, and optimizers. To do this, you will need to update the input dimensions for both models. For the generator, you will need to calculate the size of the input vector; recall that for conditional GANs, the generator's input is the noise vector concatenated with the class vector. For the discriminator, you need to add a channel for every class.


```python
# UNQ_C3 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: get_input_dimensions
def get_input_dimensions(z_dim, mnist_shape, n_classes):
    '''
    Function for getting the size of the conditional input dimensions 
    from z_dim, the image shape, and number of classes.
    Parameters:
        z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector, a scalar
        mnist_shape: the shape of each MNIST image as (C, W, H), which is (1, 28, 28)
        n_classes: the total number of classes in the dataset, an integer scalar
                (10 for MNIST)
    Returns: 
        generator_input_dim: the input dimensionality of the conditional generator, 
                          which takes the noise and class vectors
        discriminator_im_chan: the number of input channels to the discriminator
                            (e.g. C x 28 x 28 for MNIST)
    '''
    #### START CODE HERE ####
    generator_input_dim = z_dim + n_classes
    discriminator_im_chan = mnist_shape[0] + n_classes
    #### END CODE HERE ####
    return generator_input_dim, discriminator_im_chan
```


```python
def test_input_dims():
    gen_dim, disc_dim = get_input_dimensions(23, (12, 23, 52), 9)
    assert gen_dim == 32
    assert disc_dim == 21
test_input_dims()
print("Success!")
```

    Success!



```python
generator_input_dim, discriminator_im_chan = get_input_dimensions(z_dim, mnist_shape, n_classes)

gen = Generator(input_dim=generator_input_dim).to(device)
gen_opt = torch.optim.Adam(gen.parameters(), lr=lr)
disc = Discriminator(im_chan=discriminator_im_chan).to(device)
disc_opt = torch.optim.Adam(disc.parameters(), lr=lr)

def weights_init(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d) or isinstance(m, nn.ConvTranspose2d):
        torch.nn.init.normal_(m.weight, 0.0, 0.02)
    if isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
        torch.nn.init.normal_(m.weight, 0.0, 0.02)
        torch.nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)
gen = gen.apply(weights_init)
disc = disc.apply(weights_init)
```

Now to train, you would like both your generator and your discriminator to know what class of image should be generated. There are a few locations where you will need to implement code.

For example, if you're generating a picture of the number "1", you would need to:

1.   Tell that to the generator, so that it knows it should be generating a "1"
2.   Tell that to the discriminator, so that it knows it should be looking at a "1". If the discriminator is told it should be looking at a 1 but sees something that's clearly an 8, it can guess that it's probably fake

There are no explicit unit tests here -- if this block of code runs and you don't change any of the other variables, then you've done it correctly!


```python
# UNQ_C4 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED CELL
cur_step = 0
generator_losses = []
discriminator_losses = []

#UNIT TEST NOTE: Initializations needed for grading
noise_and_labels = False

disc_real_pred = False

for epoch in range(n_epochs):
    # Dataloader returns the batches and the labels
    for real, labels in tqdm(dataloader):
        cur_batch_size = len(real)
        # Flatten the batch of real images from the dataset
        real = real.to(device)

        one_hot_labels = get_one_hot_labels(labels.to(device), n_classes)
        image_one_hot_labels = one_hot_labels[:, :, None, None]
        image_one_hot_labels = image_one_hot_labels.repeat(1, 1, mnist_shape[1], mnist_shape[2])

## Exploration
You can do a bit of exploration now!


```python
# Before you explore, you should put the generator
# in eval mode, both in general and so that batch norm
# doesn't cause you issues and is using its eval statistics
gen = gen.eval()
```

#### Changing the Class Vector
You can generate some numbers with your new model! You can add interpolation as well to make it more interesting.

So starting from a image, you will produce intermediate images that look more and more like the ending image until you get to the final image. Your're basically morphing one image into another. You can choose what these two images will be using your conditional GAN.


```python
import math

### Change me! ###
n_interpolation = 9 # Choose the interpolation: how many intermediate images you want + 2 (for the start and end image)
interpolation_noise = get_noise(1, z_dim, device=device).repeat(n_interpolation, 1)

def interpolate_class(first_number, second_number):
    first_label = get_one_hot_labels(torch.Tensor([first_number]).long(), n_classes)
    second_label = get_one_hot_labels(torch.Tensor([second_number]).long(), n_classes)

    # Calculate the interpolation vector between the two labels
    percent_second_label = torch.linspace(0, 1, n_interpolation)[:, None]
    interpolation_labels = first_label * (1 - percent_second_label) + second_label * percent_second_label

    # Combine the noise and the labels
    noise_and_labels = combine_vectors(interpolation_noise, interpolation_labels.to(device))
    fake = gen(noise_and_labels)
    show_tensor_images(fake, num_images=n_interpolation, nrow=int(math.sqrt(n_interpolation)), show=False)

### Change me! ###
start_plot_number = 1 # Choose the start digit
### Change me! ###
end_plot_number = 5 # Choose the end digit

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
interpolate_class(start_plot_number, end_plot_number)
_ = plt.axis('off')

plot_numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
n_numbers = len(plot_numbers)

#### Changing the Noise Vector
Now, what happens if you hold the class constant, but instead you change the noise vector? You can also interpolate the noise vector and generate an image at each step.


```python
n_interpolation = 9 # How many intermediate images you want + 2 (for the start and end image)

# This time you're interpolating between the noise instead of the labels
interpolation_label = get_one_hot_labels(torch.Tensor([5]).long(), n_classes).repeat(n_interpolation, 1).float()

def interpolate_noise(first_noise, second_noise):
    # This time you're interpolating between the noise instead of the labels
    percent_first_noise = torch.linspace(0, 1, n_interpolation)[:, None].to(device)
    interpolation_noise = first_noise * percent_first_noise + second_noise * (1 - percent_first_noise)

    # Combine the noise and the labels again
    noise_and_labels = combine_vectors(interpolation_noise, interpolation_label.to(device))
    fake = gen(noise_and_labels)
    show_tensor_images(fake, num_images=n_interpolation, nrow=int(math.sqrt(n_interpolation)), show=False)

# Generate noise vectors to interpolate between
### Change me! ###
n_noise = 5 # Choose the number of noise examples in the grid
plot_noises = [get_noise(1, z_dim, device=device) for i in range(n_noise)]
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
for i, first_plot_noise in enumerate(plot_noises):
    for j, second_plot_noise in enumerate(plot_noises):
        plt.subplot(n_noise, n_noise, i * n_noise + j + 1)
        interpolate_noise(first_plot_noise, second_plot_noise)
        plt.axis('off')
plt.subplots_adjust(top=1, bottom=0, left=0, right=1, hspace=0.1, wspace=0)
plt.show()
plt.close()
```
