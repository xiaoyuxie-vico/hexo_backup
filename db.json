Although a softmax function can normalize the results, it cannot be used to identify unknown class samples and hard samples. A low predict score for a certain class does not mean an unknown class or a hard sample. In addition, it is hard to understand which part of images have a strong inﬂuence on the ﬁnal prediction, especially for these hard samples. So, I used Gradientweighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to explain the results.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThere are two contributions in this ﬁnal project. First, I proposed a robust classiﬁcation approach to identify samples from unknown classes and hard samples. Second, I used Grad-CAM to visualization the attention of neural networks to make the results more explainable. Speciﬁcally, I ﬁnd that apparent misclassiﬁcations tend to have a larger attention area and understandable misclassiﬁcations tend to have a smaller attention are.\n\n# Dataset\n\nThe cat and dog dataset used in this project is downloaded from [Kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog). Several images are shown in the below:\n\nThe data augmentation in the training set includes random rotation (20), random crop scale (0.8, 1.0), Random Horizontal Flip, Random Aﬃne, Normalization. The test set does not use data augmentation.\n\nThe batch size is 32 and the dataset will be shuﬄed.\n\n# Model Training\n\nDetailed information about model training can be found in [trainer_cat_dog.ipynb](https://github.com/xiaoyuxie-vico/ExplainableAI/blob/master/trainer_cat_dog.ipynb).\n\nThe accuracy in the training set and the test set are 0.9809 and 0.9812 respectively.\n\n# Error analysis (test set)\n\nAlthought the accuracy is high (more than 0.98), the trained model still can make some errors.

Apparent misclassiﬁcations tend to have a larger attention area; \n2. Understandable misclassiﬁcations tend to have a smaller attention area;\n\n# Distribution analysis\n\nTo solve the problem about apparent misclassiﬁcations and reduce the number of understandable misclassiﬁcations, we want to analyze the distribution of logits and scores for diﬀerent classes.\n\nBelow, we analyzed the distribution of logits for cat and dog class. The results show that the absolute value for most of logits are in [2, 7], which means that in our training set it is rarely for the model to make a prediction with a lower logits (around 0) or a higher logit (greater than 7 or less than -7). Thus, it is unresonable to believe the prediction if model give such logits.

Thus, we downloaded three kind of images including a human face, landscape, and apples, which are shown in the below. All of these classes are not included in the training set.

But we can ﬁnd that for the ﬁrst and third image the model give a high score, which means the model make some serious misclassiﬁcations.\n\nFor the fourth and ﬁveth image, even though they are also come from the Internet, the model can give a good prediciton and high scores.

Now, we will analyze the test set. The results are shown below.

Then we can use this conclusion to identify the unseen classes images and improve the robustness of the model.</p>\n<p><img src=\"6.png\"></p>\n<p>In the above, we test some images from the Internet. Now, we will analyze the test set. The results are shown below. These results also show that a threshold of 0.04 for the average of density is good enough to elimate the wrong predictions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"7.png\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h1><ul>\n<li>The proposed image classiﬁcation approach can identify data out of training set based on logits kernel density estimation; </li>\n<li>The proposed image classiﬁcation approach can help to improve accuracy by identifying data with low density; </li>\n<li>The proposed approach is explainable and can be understand visually;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"More-resources\"><a href=\"#More-resources\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"More resources\"></a>More resources</h1><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xiaoyuxie-vico/ExplainableAI\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/cIIOdQHTQu4\">Youtube Explanation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this project is my final project for EE475 at Northwestern University in 2020 Fall.</p>"}],"PostAsset":[{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/1.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"1.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/2.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"2.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/3.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"3.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/4.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"4.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/5.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"5.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/6.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"6.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/Robust-Image-Classification-with-Kernel-Density-Function/7.png","post":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","slug":"7.png","modified":1,"renderable":1}],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"ckjm60r5d0002sgzwbc9j6usg","tag_id":"ckjm60r5i0004sgzw0c3eb13s","_id":"ckjm60r5m0006sgzwh01zc94c"},{"post_id":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","tag_id":"ckjm60r5k0005sgzw1b0y8ptp","_id":"ckjm60r5n0009sgzw5zhk6llf"},{"post_id":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","tag_id":"ckjm60r5m0007sgzwb0d4dakw","_id":"ckjm60r5n000asgzwgk5985br"},{"post_id":"ckjm60r5g0003sgzwa6q2hng2","tag_id":"ckjm60r5m0008sgzw483agdti","_id":"ckjm60r5n000bsgzwh7an0nb7"}],"Tag":[{"name":"Life","_id":"ckjm60r5i0004sgzw0c3eb13s"},{"name":"Class Project","_id":"ckjm60r5k0005sgzw1b0y8ptp"},{"name":"Deep Learning","_id":"ckjm60r5m0007sgzwb0d4dakw"},{"name":"Computer Vision","_id":"ckjm60r5m0008sgzw483agdti"}]}}
